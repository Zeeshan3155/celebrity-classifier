# Celebrity Classifier

This is an end-to-end project that involves building a classification model using SVM to identify Indian celebrities from user-uploaded images. A Flask server will be built to serve HTTP requests and a website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for users to interact. The project is currently restricted to 5 celebrities.
